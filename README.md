## Hi there!

### What I'm working on
- [duckOS](https://github.com/byteduck/duckOS/), my hobby UNIX-like operating system that runs in 32-bit protected mode, has preemptive multitasking, a dynamically-linked userspace, a window manager / compositor, and more!
- [Notedown](https://github.com/byteduck/notedown/), a hybrid Markdown/LaTeX/WYSIWYG note-taking application for macOS written with SwiftUI and Cocoa.


### A poem

```
Roses are red, my code's a disaster
git push --force origin master
```
